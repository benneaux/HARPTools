When you want to see the variation, especially the highs and lows, of a metric like stock price, on an actual calendar itself, the calendar heat map is a great tool. It emphasizes the variation visually over time rather than the actual value itself.
This can be implemented using the geom_tile. But getting it in the right format has more to do with the data preparation rather than the plotting itself.

```
```{r DataManipution}
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/yahoo.csv")
df$date <- as.Date(df$date)  # format date
df <- df[df$year >= 2012, ]  # filter reqd years
# Create Month Week
df$yearmonth <- as.yearmon(df$date)
df$yearmonthf <- factor(df$yearmonth)
df <- ddply(df,.(yearmonthf), transform, monthweek=1+week-min(week))  # compute week number of month
df <- df[, c("year", "yearmonthf", "monthf", "week", "monthweek", "weekdayf", "VIX.Close")]
head(df)
```

```{r Plot}
# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(monthweek, weekdayf, fill = VIX.Close)) + 
  geom_tile(colour = "white") + 
  facet_grid(year~monthf) +
